# Machine learning notebook
This repository is a collection of notes and files that I created while self-teaching machine learning. The comment lines in the scripts are written with descriptions based on my own understanding, as well as questions which I will come back later as I learn more and get more knowledge. 

It is mainly served as a personal notebook but it may be useful for other machine learning beginners.
